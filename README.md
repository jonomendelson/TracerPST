# TracerPST

TracerPST is a cell tracking algorithm that detects cells in blurry and low-contrast time-lapse images, generates lineage trees and marks cell death events. Previously, researchers in a partnered UCLA biology lab would manually inspect thousands of images of cells when conducting studies on immunotherapy or drug development. Not only does our cell tracking algorithm save biologists a significant amount of time, but it appreciably improved on the accuracy of CellProfiler (https://github.com/CellProfiler/CellProfiler), industry standard software. I developed the algorithm in C++ and used openCV with guidance and data from the biologists.

The cell tracking algorithm was presented at the SPIE OPTO conference (http://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/photonics-west/opto) in January 2018.
